# Minecraft-Tree-Finder
Detecting neural networks in Minecraft.

If you want to run this yourself, you will need pytorch, torchvision, and pycocotools installed as well as the scrips coco_eval.py, coco_utils.py, engine.py, transforms.py, and utils.py from https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/detection. I'm not sure if I am allowed to just cipy those into my own repository so to be safe I'm just linking them.
